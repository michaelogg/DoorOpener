## Basic Methodology
* Brief description of method of operation

## Components
* `Vera` : Z-Wave hub that connects the contact closures and switches.
* `Raspberry Pi` : Main controller that connects to Vera and all other components via USB.
* `RFID Reader` : Device used to read RFID tags
* `Z-Wave Compatible Door Strike Relay` : Remote switch used to open or close the door latch.
* `Z-Wave Compatible Door Open Relay` : Same device as the strike relay but used to turn the door lock on or off.
* `Push Plates` : In this project, two pushplates are used as switches to actuate the door open relay. One is installed at an average height and the other is installed at foot level height.

## Installation
The installation process is fairly simple and straight forward:

When Pi boots, push button and system is initialized.

## Usage
* Write walk Michael talked about
* Include snippets of code
